# A Journey Into ML Algorithms

I share here some machine learning code samples, written in _Julia_, _Python_, and _R_. They serve general-purpose applications. Some of the main topics include, but are not restricted to:
1. Regression;
1. Classification;
1. Clustering;
1. Artificial Neural Network (MLP and CNN).

For reference, I put, inside the folder _RUN-THROUGH_, screenshots of algorithms being executed, which show what the outcomes of the running codes would look like.
